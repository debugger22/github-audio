# GitHub Audio - React Edition

A modern React + TypeScript + Vite reimplementation of the GitHub Audio project that converts real-time GitHub events into beautiful music and visualizations.

## 🎵 What is GitHub Audio?

GitHub Audio listens to events happening across GitHub and converts them into music notes and visual effects. Each type of GitHub event (pushes, issues, pull requests, etc.) produces different sounds and visual elements, creating a unique musical experience from the world's largest code repository.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time GitHub Events**: Connects to live GitHub event streams via WebSocket
- **Audio Generation**: Different GitHub events trigger different musical notes
  - Push events → Celesta sounds
  - Issues/PRs → Clav sounds  
  - Random swell sounds for ambiance
- **Dual Visualization Modes**: 
  - **2D Mode**: D3.js powered animations with colored circles for each event
  - **3D Mode**: Three.js powered 3D space with colorful floating spheres, a realistic fireball sun, and gravitational effects
- **Interactive 3D Experience**: Orbit controls for zooming, panning, and rotating the 3D scene with realistic gravitational pull animations
- **Event Filtering**: Filter events by organization or repository name
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable audio volume
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with React, TypeScript, styled-components, and Vite

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: styled-components (CSS-in-JS)
- **Audio**: Howler.js
- **2D Visualizations**: D3.js
- **3D Visualizations**: Three.js (vanilla implementation for maximum compatibility)
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **WebSockets**: Native WebSocket API
